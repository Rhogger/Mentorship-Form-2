## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was made in the 1nd module of Explorer level 3 - Rocketseat.

In this project, I reinforced my knowledge about spacing, forms, pseudo-classes and responsiveness. I also further improved the unit of measurement for the root to make it easier to use REM values, i.e. now I can use the same px values as REM, example: 1px = 1 rem.
